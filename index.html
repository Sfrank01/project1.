<p class="paragraph">I am married and have a five year daughter. Before getting married and having my daugheter, I worked a number of years as an architect... specializing in zoo and aquarium and aviaries around the world. This seems like a strange specialty but since my first undergraduate degree was in zoology, it seemed like a perfect fit.</p>
